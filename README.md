This project was part of an internship entrance evaluation, focused on integrating data from multiple sources to analyze food delivery trends. 

Transactional, user, and restaurant data from CSV, JSON, and SQL formats were merged using left joins to create a unified dataset, final_food_delivery_dataset.csv, which serves as the single source of truth for analysis.
